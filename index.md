## Musy

With Musy you can create music on the fly with a programming language that's versatile and allows you to create songs from notes and phrases. You can also export your created songs to MIDI files and listen to them from anywhere! In this page you will find the source code as well as a language tutorial and a technical reference manual. Enjoy!

### Our Motivation

Music is something that can be created with almost anything and with a good ear. These things vary from actual musical instruments to something as simple as a table top. However, not everybody has the know-how of using a musical instrument or creating one. Some of these people may have studied music and may know how to create music but wielding an instrument is not the same thing. You can have the knowledge but if you don’t have the talent or abilities, you may never be able to create music on your own. That is what motivated us to develop Musy.
